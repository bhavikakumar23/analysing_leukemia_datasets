Analysing B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) datasets

The project aims to identify epi-transcriptomic RNA targets and RNA modifications by analysing B-ALL datasets sequenced using direct RNA sequencing. The information discovered can be useful in developing novel strategies for sensitising resistant cancer cells to the available drugs or identifying new therapeutic targets for drug development.
